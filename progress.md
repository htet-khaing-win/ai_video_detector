### Repository Initialization
Set up base repository structure, environment configuration, and reproducibility utilities. Verified TensorFlow GPU setup and mixed-precision policy with smoke tests.

### CI and Dataset Scaffolding 
Added GitHub Actions CI pipeline for linting and unit tests. Configured flake8 style enforcement. Implemented initial dataset scaffold with synthetic sample generation and basic pytest verification. Repository now ready for automated testing workflow.

### Dataset Integration & Preprocessing
Implemented GenBuster-first preprocessing pipeline: Hugging Face download + stratified sampling to balanced 50K subset. Added memory-efficient FrameExtractor (streaming, 1 FPS, 8–16 frame cap, auto-resize 224/256), PyTorch Dataset/DataLoader with lightweight augmentations and caching (.pt), debug dataset generator (100 items), and VRAM monitor with batch-size recommendation. Tests and smoke-run scripts added for fast local validation.

###Data Pipeline Finalization
- Automated full pipeline: download → extract → cache
- Verified cache integrity and DataLoader consistency
